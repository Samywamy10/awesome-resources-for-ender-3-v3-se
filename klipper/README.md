### Why this page even exists?

Me being complete n00b with my first 3D printer ever on the table had to spent quite some time searching why klipper, what do, how do. This is short excerpt for other noobs to get klipping.

### Why even bother?

Well, I don't know, I just like customize stuff and I typically root and hack any device that can be rooted or hacked. Like my vacuum cleaner speaking GLaDOS voice.

With klipper one can expand printer capabilities and add functions like Telegram or Discord notifications. Read more on [Klipper site](https://klipper3d.org).

### Should you continue?

If you have some linux knowledge, know how to use terminal, how to resolve packages dependencies, love to customize things to your needs and you're not afraid of breaking stuff I guess that's a thing for you.

If not, stay stock or buy [Sonic Pad](../README.md#sonic-pad) to get rough idea about klipper. Or watch something on YouTube.

Note: Klipper is totally reversible to stock.
